Changes in Code

In Solidity-
1. Modified RegisteredPerson function to NoOfRegisteredPerson-It returns the number of registered people
2. Added UpdatePerson function which inputs a new name and stores it in the structure created

In App.js-
1. Initialised a variable update name to false; and created a button update name so that when clicked it changes the variable to true and opens a file which contain text bar, I linked it to the solidity update person function.
2. Also similarly made a button for Name and Address , when clicked shows the users name and connected wallet
